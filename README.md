# Selenium-script-to-download-the-data-of-US-census


In this script, I automated the downloading of the employment status table using selenium. The employment data is related to US country and the data can be found in US census website. In this website, we can find the data of various states, cities and year wise and there are lot of filters using which we can get the data. The script I written takes 3 parameters: state, place/city and year. We can give state, city and year and It will automatically download a zip file where we can find an excel sheet.
